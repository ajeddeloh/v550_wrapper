These are the results from running `./vuescan 2>filename.log`. I've removed all the image data and
anything after that; these logs are everything leading up to receiving the image data.

W: means this data was written to the scanner
R: means this data was read from the scanner

All data was captured with the trial version of VueScan, but I don't see anything indicating the
full version would work any differently.

Logs in preview-runs/ are from clicking the preview button in VueScan. Logs in scan-runs are from
the scan button.
